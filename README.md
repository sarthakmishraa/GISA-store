- **Zod Validation**: Ensures that product details meet specific criteria.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy navigation and clean design.

## Short Description
GISA Store is an online marketplace where users can add products to the store by providing necessary details. Buyers can browse the listed products, view comprehensive information including the product name, description, price, and GISA Store rating, and then connect with the sellers for purchasing. The product form uses Zod validation to ensure data integrity, with constraints such as ratings between 1-5, non-negative prices, product names of at least 4 characters, and descriptions of at least 8 characters.
